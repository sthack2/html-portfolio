<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Stephanie Thacker has no idea how to write an about me page. I guess I am going to need to work on this before I finish 
  this bootcamp. It can't be too hard. I guess I am just not sure what to put first. What do people even want to know about me?</p>

<p>However, I can create paragraphs in html. It's pretty cool.</p>
